# Learning to make a compiler!

Building a compiler rom scratch to understand how programming language work!
My end goal is to make **'Photon'** a graphics-focused programming language

# Progress

- [x] Lexer
- [ ] Parser (Going to start working on a basic one)
- [ ] Code Generator - outputs executable code

# Features so far:
Lexer handles:
1. variable with underscores
2. Numbers
3. Operators (+, -, *, /, =, ==, !=, <=, >=)
4. whitespace handling
